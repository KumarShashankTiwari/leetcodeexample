//Convert a string to spinal case. Spinal case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.
//spinalCase("This Is Spinal Tap") should return the string this-is-spinal-tap.
//Passed:spinalCase("thisIsSpinalTap") should return the string this-is-spinal-tap.
//Passed:spinalCase("The_Andy_Griffith_Show") should return the string the-andy-griffith-show.

 "\s+" means a sequence of one or more whitespace characters. The "\s" is a shorthand character class that matches any whitespace character, 
 including spaces, tabs, and line breaks, and the "+" is a
 quantifier that matches one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern. So "\s+" will match one or more consecutive whitespace characters.

function spinalCase(str) {
  // Create a variable for the white space and underscores.
  var regex = /\s+|_+/g;

  // Replace low-upper case to low-space-uppercase
  str = str.replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, "$1 $2");

  // Replace space and underscore with -
  return str.replace(regex, "-").toLowerCase();
}

// test here
spinalCase("This Is Spinal Tap");


//replace and with & note- it replace first occurance of and or element
//The "\d" is a shorthand character class in regex that matches any digit characte
// the "+" symbol is a quantifier that means "one or more occurrences of the preceding element"
//. So, if the regex were actually "\d+", it would match one or more digits (0-9).

const myStr ="Hey, I'm 25 and she is 31!";
console.log(myStr.replace("and","&"));
// replace both 25 and 31 to 22
console.log(myStr.replace(/\d+/g,"22"));
//interchange 25 and 31
console.log(myStr.replace(/(\d+)([^\d]+)(\d+)/g,"$3$2$1"));
